Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages—typically libraries—of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.
You can use it for your own libraries.
